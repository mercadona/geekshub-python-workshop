Welcome to this Hacendado challenge where you will be implementing an amazing grocery e-commerce shopping cart using the Python programming language!

We've prepared a catalog (pun intended) of tests to guide you through this implementation.

The main objective is to implement a Cart class that is initialized with a catalog dictionary (that contains the list of available products and their price). This Cart object must have an add, remove and total_price methods that allow us to interact with it. Futhermore, those actions raise several excepcions in some cases, more info about this in the tests.

## Running the test suite

You'll pass the challenge by implementing a `Cart` class that makes the tests pass. Tests can be run by typing:

    python tests.py

Good Luck and Have Fun fellow Hacendacoders!
